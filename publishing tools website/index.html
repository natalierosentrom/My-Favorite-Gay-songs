        Honey, when I'm above the trees </br>
            I see this for what it is</br>
            But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given</br>
            Is just shit we're dividin' up</br>
            Showed you all of my hiding spots</br>
            I was dancing when the music stopped</br>
            And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention</br>
            I havent met the new me yet</br>
            </br>
            There'll be happiness after you</br>
            But there was happiness because of you</br>

            Both of these things can be true</br>
            There is happiness</br>
            </br>
            Past the blood and bruise</br>
            Past the curses and cries</br>
            Beyond the terror in the nightfall</br>

            Haunted by the look in my eyes</br>
            That would've loved you for a lifetime</br>
            Leave it all behind</br>
            And there is happiness</br>
            </br>
            Tell me, when did your winning smile</br>
            Begin to look like a smirk?</br>
            When did all our lessons start to look like weapons</br>
            Pointed at my deepest hurt?</br>
            I hope she'll be a beautiful fool</br>
            Who takes my spot next to you</br>
            No, I didn't mean that</br>
            Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury</br>
            You haven't met the new me yet</br>
            <br>
                There'll be happiness after me</br>
            But there was happiness because of me</br>
            Both of these things, I believe</br>
            There is happiness </br>
            </br>
            In our history, across our great divide</br>
            There is a glorious sunrise</br>
            Dappled with the flickers of light</br>
            From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind</br>
            And there is happiness</br>
        </br>
        I can't make it go away by making you a villain</br>
        I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven</br>
        And I pulled your body into mine</br>
        Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties</br>
        No one teaches you what to do</br>
        When a good man hurts you</br>
        And you know you hurt him too</br>

            After giving you the best I had</br>
            Tell me what to give after that</br>
            All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness </br>
            You haven't met the new me yet</br>
            And I think she'll give you that</br>

    Haven't felt right in a week</br>
    And I'm thinning out</br>
    And it hurts bad</br>
    I gotta get back</br>
    Hot head and dreamless sleep</br>
    I could just slip down</br>
    And on the wrong track</br>
    I gotta get back</br>
    <br>
    I wanna spend the entire year</br>
    Just faced down</br>
    And on my own time</br>
    I wanna waste mine</br>
    <br>
    And spend the rest of it asking myself</br>
    "Is this who you are?"</br>
    And I don't know</br>
    It just feels gross</br>
    <br>
    And I don't think there's anything wrong</br>
    I don't think there's anything wrong</br>
    And I don't think there's anything wrong</br>
    I don't think there's anything wrong</br>
    <br>
    Sunlight on the back of my arms</br>
    Just thins me out</br>
    To a different time</br>
    I wanna waste mine</br>

    I see the signs of a lifetime, you till I die <br>
    And I'm swiftly out, Irish goodbye <br>
    <br>
    What if it's not meant for me? <br>
    Love <br>
    What if it's not meant for me? <br>
    Love <br>
    <br>
    I'd like to get to know you <br>
    I'd like to take you out<br>
    We'd go to The Hail Mary<br>
    And afterwards make out<br>
    Instead, I'm typing you a message<br>
    That I know I'll never send<br>
    Rewriting old excuses<br>
    Delete the kisses at the end<br>
    When I see you, the whole world reduces<br>
    To just that room<br>
    And then I remember and I'm shy<br>
    That gossip's eye will look too soon<br>
    And then I'm trapped, overthinking<br>
    And yeah, probably self-doubt<br>
    You tell me to get over it<br>
    And to take you out<br>
    But I can't, I'm too scared<br>
    And here's the night bus, I have to go<br>
    And the doors are closing, and you were waving<br>
    And I like you, and I'll never let it show<br>
    And you won't wait, and maybe I won't mind<br>
    I work better on my own<br>
    And now I'm home, a little bit drunk<br>
    And I ask myself
    <br>
    What if it's not meant for me?<br>
    Love<br>
    What if it's not meant for me?<br>
    Love<br>
    <br>
    A few days pass since I last saw you<br>
    And you've taken over my mind<br>
    I'm retelling jokes you made that made me laugh<br>
    Pretending that they're mine<br>
    I wanna tell the whole world about you<br>
    I think that that's a sign<br>
    I'm losing self-control and it's you<br>
    It really is, one thousand times<br>
    I look at your picture and I smile<br>
    How awful's that? I'm like a teenage girl<br>
    I might as well write all over my notebook<br>
    That you "rock my world"<br>
    But you do, you really do<br>
    You've turned me upside down<br>
    And that's okay, I'll let it happen<br>
    'Cause I like having you around<br>
    I'm electric, a romantic clichÃ©<br>
    Yeah, they really are all true<br>
    When we catch eyes at that stupid party<br>
    I know exactly what to do<br>
    I'll take your hand, and we will leave<br>
    French exits from me and you<br>
    And now I'm home, a little bit drunk<br>
    Some things don't change<br>
    And I know now<br>
    <br>
    Me and you were meant to be<br>
    In love<br>
    Me and you were meant to be<br>
    In love<br>
    Me and you<br>
    <br>
    I see the signs of a lifetime, you till I die <br>

    Met you at the dive bar to go shoot some pool<br>
    And make fun of the cowboys with the neck tattoos<br>
    Ask you easy questions about work and school<br>
    I'm trying to be cool about feeling like an absolute fool about<br>
    Wishing you were kind enough to be cruel about it<br>
    Telling myself I can always do without it<br>
    Knowing that it probably isn't true<br>
    <br>
    I came prepared for absolution if you'd only ask<br>
    So I take some offense when you say, "No regrets"<br>
    I remember it's impossible to pass your test<br>
    But I'm trying to forget about it<br>
    Feeling like I'm breaking a sweat about it<br>
    Wishing you would kindly get out of my head about it<br>
    Telling myself one day I'll forget about it<br>
    Knowing that it probably isn't true <br>
    <br>
    Once I took your medication to know what it's like<br>
    And now I have to act like I can't read your mind<br>
    I ask you how you're doing and I let you lie<br>
    But we don't have to talk about it<br>
    I can walk you home and practice method acting<br>
    I'll pretend being with you doesn't feel like drowning<br>
    Telling you it's nice to see how good you're doing<br>
    Even though we know it isn't true<br>

    I used to see her almost every day and when I didn't, I didn't feel so great<br>
    When we were together, I thought everything was better<br>
    Now I just have to pretend I just never cared that much<br>
    <br>
    I hate her<br>
    And I love her<br>
    <br>
    You ask me why I'm getting so upset<br>
    You don't understand a girl who's passionate for another girl<br>
    One day I think I love her then I think I want to kill her<br>
    You tell me to calm down, what is your fucking problem?<br>
    <br>
    I hate her<br>
    And I love her<br>
    <br>
    You said it once to me that girls are friends and friendships end<br>
    And memories all in my head of love so strong it'd knock you dead<br>
    They're thrown away like a melted ring and you just can't say anything<br>
    And even though I know that's not true I still don't know what to do<br>
    <br>
    I hate her<br>
    And I love her<br>
    I hate her<br>
    And I love her<br>
    I hate, I hate, I hate her<br>
